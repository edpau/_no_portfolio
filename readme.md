Question:
1. I mixed the variables in var() and $, it is ok?
2. Is my BEM ok? 
3. Is my dark mode ok? 


After MVP
1. image compress to speed up loading time

2. fix each section different size 
3. fix about me small screen text box
4. should not use image container in intro? 
5. refactor class name BEM text to para?
6. refactor width to min-width or max-width if possible
7. project image ratio is to fix, as i used fixed height now
8. section width not so responsive, can improve, use footer idea, contain it in one more layer. 
9. svg footer position sightly high after adding a tag
10. dark mode chose from local storage

Note:
I used a tag for button instead of button, accessibility reason, need to add back accessibility requirement
